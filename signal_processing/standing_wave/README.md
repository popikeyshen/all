If we have transceiver 1 and transceiver 2 and we wanna to make an area of ​​space with high voltage

<p align="center"> <img src="wave.gif"  width = 40%  /></p>
<p align="center"> <img src="wave2.png"  width = 40%  /></p>

There the result of 2 transceivers will be

```
res = signal1 - signal2
```
