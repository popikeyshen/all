# Fourier transorm

In mathematics, a Fourier transform (FT) is a mathematical transform that decomposes functions 
In this folders are examples of fft and his code. 
In this readme separately need to write about similar decompose metods for next updates.
Simmilar to fourier tranfroms are:
  - wavelet transforms like in JPEG2000
  - haar transform
  - window function
Where the signal must be finite and for infinite signals we can remember taylor series as example
