# Fourier transorm

In mathematics, a Fourier transform (FT) is a mathematical transform that decomposes functions. <p>
In this folders are examples of fft and his code. <p>
In this readme separately need to write about similar decompose metods for next updates.<p>
Simmilar to fourier tranfroms are:<p>
  - wavelet transforms like in JPEG2000<p>
  - haar transform<p>
  - window function<p>
Where the signal must be finite and for infinite signals we can remember taylor series as example<p>
