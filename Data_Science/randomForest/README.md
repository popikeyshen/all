About RandomForest and other threes

[Random_forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) 
Main idea is about:
1) bagging
2) random substance method
Main steps are:
1. Create N-decision three's:
      a. Loop, crop, N
      b. look entropy of x and y for every N
      c. the less entropy is our NODE
      d. go back to step a, stop if depth or entropy is too big

2. Bootstrap them (N-th three is with own cropped dataset)
3. Get resalt (Most common label)
