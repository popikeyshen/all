There are two different types of problem in solving
jigsaw puzzles. One of them is a pattern recognition
problem. The other one is a combinatorial problem. Most of
previous works have elaborated just on the first problem,
but the second problem has not been investigated properly.
This paper specifically aimed at this problem.
